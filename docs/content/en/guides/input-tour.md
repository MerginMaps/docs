## Installation

Download Input App from Google Play or App Store: 

<template><AppDownload /></template>

Once you have installed and opened Input you will see two tour projects:

![Input's Tour Projects](images/input-tour-projects.png)

These tours introduce the basics of Input.

![Welcome to Input](images/welcome-to-input.png)

When you have completed both tours, well learn how to create a new project 
for your field data.

## Create a Project

The easiest way to create a new project is from a template.

The *Field Notes* template comes with simple background mapping and allows 
you to create points, lines and areas with field notes and photos:

## Create a free Mergin account

You can carry out these steps from your mobile or desktop web browser - 
either will be OK.

* Go to the <a href="https://public.cloudmergin.com/" target=_blank>Mergin 
website</a> and create a new account.


## Create a project

You should now be logged-in to Mergin. 

* Create a new project using the button shown below:

![Create a Mergin Project](images/create-mergin-project.png)

* Set *Template project* to *Field notes*
* Give the project a name

![Create a Mergin Project from a Template](images/create-mergin-project-from-template.png)

Your namespace will look different to that shown in the example above. 

* Press *CREATE* to create the project

The project has now been created on Mergin. The next step is to get it onto 
our device.

## Put it on Your Device

We're almost ready to start surveying - we just need to get the project onto 
our device.

* Open Input and press *My projects*

![My projects in Input](images/my-projects.png)

You should now see the new project we just created. If you see a Mergin 
login prompt, enter your Mergin account details to login then go to *My projects*.

![Downloading the Mergin Project into Input](images/download-mergin-project-onto-input.png)

* Press the download button

The project should now be shown with a check mark:

![Synced Mergin Project with Check Mark](images/project-with-check-mark.png)

At this stage you can open the project from *Home* and start adding notes 
and map features. In the next section we'll see how to push changes back 
to Mergin.

## Sync Your Changes

So by now you've taken some really insightful field notes and great 
photos and want to sync these changes back to your project.

* Go to *My projects* (if you have your map open you may need to first press *Projects*

When sync changes are pending, your project will have two sync arrows 
next to it:

![Sync Arrows Mean Project Changes are Pending](images/sync-arrows.png)

* Press the sync arrows to synchronise your project

When the sync completes, you'll see a check mark:

![Check Mark Means All Changes Are Synced](images/project-with-check-mark.png)

That's all there is to syncing - your changes have been saved on Mergin 
and any changes made by your collaborators have also been synced onto your 
device.

Let's now see how we can share our project.

## Share Your Project

Now you know how to create a project, get it onto your mobile, make changes 
and sync them back to Mergin. Let's now see how we can share our project 
with others.

These settings are made through the <a href="https://public.cloudmergin.com/" target=_blank>Mergin 
website</a>.

* When logged-in to Mergin, locate *My projects*

![My projects in Mergin](images/my-projects-in-mergin.png)

* Press on the project you want to share

![Open Mergin project to share](images/open-project-to-share.png)

* Press the settings button to access sharing settings

![Mergin project settings](images/mergin-project-settings.png)

* Use search tool to find the user you wish to share the project with and press *ADD* to grant access.

![Find user to share project with](images/find-user-to-share-project-with.png)

So far the user we just added will have read permission. From here we could 
also grant them write permissions or owner permissions. Owner permission 
means they will also be able to adjust sharing settings on the project.

![Mergin project permissions](images/mergin-project-permissions.png)

From here you can also use the *MAKE PUBLIC* button to make the project 
public. This makes the project readable by any user. If you wanted people 
to have write access to the project you'd still need to explicitly share 
it with them and grant them write access though.

That's the end of the Quick Start Guide but there's loads more information 
in the <a href="/">main documentation</a> such as how to carry out a typical 
Input workflow:

* Preparing project: user loads background and survey layers, set up the forms, apply styling to the layers, set up map themes and define the layers to be used for survey purpose. See [Project preparation](./project_config)

* Data/project transfer: once the project set up, users need to transfer data to the device. This can be achieved through [Mergin](https://public.cloudmergin.com). See [Data transfer](./data_sync)

* Working with Input: map navigation, data editing, including filling the forms, viewing existing data and uploading the changes back to Mergin. See [Using Input](using_input)

* Input user interface: describes various buttons, options and configurations. See [Input user interface](input_ui)
