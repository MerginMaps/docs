In this post, we will download the [project set up in the previous tutorial](./qgis-new-project) and uploaded [to Mergin](./data-transfer.html), to our mobile device and start collecting data using the [Input app](https://inputapp.io).


# Collecting data using Input app

The project can now be accessed from the Input app. Open your Input app and for the first time you should see a screen similar to the image below:

Select the download icon on the right side of **Potholes survey** to download your project on the phone and make it ready for survey.

After downloading is completed, select **Home** and you should be able to see **Potholes survey**.

To record a feature, select **Record** button and the pointer changes to a cross-hair.

By default, the cross-hair centres to your location (the orange point) on the map. You can move the map and adjust the location. To recentre the map to your location, you can select **GPS** button. Once you are happy with the location, you can select **Add point** and the form for your point will appear:

Fill in the form and press **Save**. You should see the map with the newly captured pothole:
