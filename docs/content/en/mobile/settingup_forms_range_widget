## Range widget

In this section, a behaviour of the range widget in Input is described. 
It includes also comparison with behaviour with QGIS range widget (QGIS 3.18).
For comparison, a test project **lutraconsulting/test_decimals** is used.

Each field has different field configuration and uses GPKG column of type `double`.
List of fields contained in the test project can be found below. 

### Input methods
The range widget allows user to change value in two ways - using either the spinbox widget or typing a value in a text field.
Here is characteristics of both input methods.

##### Text input
Parses string value in locale format. If given value is a decimal number with precision more than precision set in 
the field config, those decimals are ignored (for input `"123.45"` -> sets value to `123`). 

**NOTE** that Input is sensitive to QML locale of the app. Whereas QGIS parses string numbers containing both `,` or `.` 
as delimiter, Input accepts value only in current locale format 
([read more here](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-qtqml-number.html#fromLocaleString-method)).  

##### Spin box
Essentially, contains two (arrow) buttons, one for decreasing and one for increasing a value by `step` defined in the field config.
The value has to respect `Minimum` and `Maximum` - if the limit is hit, the corresponding button is disabled.
If a value +- `step` overreaches `Minimum` or `Maximum` limit, the limit value is set as a result value (case of **field_6**).

Similarly to text field, a result value respects `precision`. However, even if `precision` in the field configuration 
is less than precision given for `step`, spinbox actually changes a value, but the change may not be visible and applied (see case of **field_2**).

**NOTE** that Input has stronger restriction for supported range. In spite of min/max, the range is set by [QML Integer range](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-int.html).
So higher the precision or step precision is, the lower number can the spinbox work with (case of **field_4**).  

### Field configurations
The field configuration taken into consideration in Input includes following parameters:
* **Minimum** - default value depends on minimal value of field type*
* **Maximum** - default value depends on macimal value of field type*
* **Step** - supports decimal number only for `double` fields
* **Precision** - only for `double` fields
* **Suffix**

*Minimal/Maximal in the INPUT is restricted to QML Integer.

### 1. **field_1**

| param     | value |
|---------- |------ |
| Minimum   | -     |
| Maximum   | -     |
| Step      | 1     |
| Precision | 0     |

This is a default config for range widget.

### 2. **field_2** 

| param     | value |
|---------- |------ |
| Minimum   | -     |
| Maximum   | -     |
| Step      | 0.1   |
| Precision | 0     |

### 3. **field_3** 

| param     | value |
|---------- |------ |
| Minimum   | -     |
| Maximum   | -     |
| Step      | 0.1   |
| Precision | 1     |

##### QGIS & INPUT
* Spinbox - as described in input methods section.

* Text input - as described in input methods section.

### 4. **field_4** 

| param     | value |
|---------- |------ |
| Minimum   | -     |
| Maximum   | -     |
| Step      | 1     |
| Precision | 8     |

##### QGIS & INPUT
* Spinbox - as described in input methods section.

* Text input - as described in input methods section.

### 5. **field_5** 

| param     | value |
|---------- |------ |
| Minimum   | -10   |
| Maximum   | 10    |
| Step      | 1     |
| Precision | 1     |

##### QGIS
* Spinbox - **different behavior**: when a user overreaches `Minimum`, the value is set to NULL.
After increase NULL value by one step, the value is `-9,1` instead of `-10` as expected. There is no such issue while hitting maximum value.  

* Text input - as described in input methods section.

| Maximum   | 10    |
| Step      | 100   |
| Precision | 1     |
