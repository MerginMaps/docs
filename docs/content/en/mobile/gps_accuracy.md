Your GPS accuracy depends on several parameters, such as:
- Your device
- View of the clear sky

When recording a point, it is essential to be aware of the limitations of your GPS accuracy at the time of recording. A warning will appear, if your accuracy is outside the GPS accuracy threshold. The warning also displays the accuracy radius.

If you'd like to have  a better accuracy, you can wait for your device to acquire a better GPS signal. Alternatively, you can connect your device to an [external GPS provider](./external_gps).

To get rid of this warning, you can increase your **Accuracy threshold** under **Settings**.
