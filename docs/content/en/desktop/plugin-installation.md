	3.1 In the **Search** section, type: Mergin

	3.2 Select Mergin in the filtered section and then click **Install Plugin**

2. In the new window, type in your username (or email address used for signing up with Mergin) and password

You can select to store the password. For that you need to have already configured your [QGIS password manager](https://docs.qgis.org/3.16/en/docs/user_manual/auth_system/auth_overview.html?#master-password)
