# Subscriptions and Invoicing
[[toc]]

After signing up to <MainPlatformNameLink />, you can use your workspace for free during the **28 day trial**. After the trial, you can choose from our <MainDomainNameLink id="pricing" desc="subscription plans"/> depending on the storage size, size of your team, support level and other features that you need for your [workspace](../../manage/workspaces/). 

There are three paid plans: *Individual*, *Professional*, and *Team* plan. Students and educators can use our free *Academia* plan and there is also a *Non-profit* plan available to charities and non-profit organisations. Subscriptions are billed monthly or annually.
