## Subscriptions

::: tip
For details about different subscription plans visit the <MainDomainNameLink id="pricing" desc="pricing"/> page.

After signing up, you can use your workspace for free during the **28 day trial**. After the trial, you can choose from our <MainDomainNameLink id="pricing" desc="subscription plans"/> depending on the storage size, size of your team, support level and other features that you need for your [workspace](../../manage/workspaces/). 

There are three paid plans: *Individual*, *Professional*, and *Team* plan. Students and educators can use our free *Academia* plan and there is also a *Non-profit* plan available to charities and non-profit organisations.

### How to transfer ownership and billing for workspaces
Ownership of a workspace can be transferred to another [workspace member](../permissions/#workspace-member-roles). Users with the **owner** member role have access to the subscriptions and invoicing settings and can change the billing details in the **Subscriptions** tab in <AppDomainNameLink />. Every workspace has to have at least one owner, however, there can be multiple owners of one workspace.

To transfer the ownership of a workspace to a user that is not yet a member of your workspace, follow the steps in [How to add users to a workspace](../project-advanced/#add-users-to-a-workspace) and select the **Owner** as the the **member role**. The new owner has to accept the invitation.

To transfer the ownership of a workspace to a user that is already a member of your workspace, you have to change their member role to **Owner**:
1. Log in to <AppDomainNameLink />
2. Navigate to the **Members** tab. Here, you will see the list of current workspace members and their roles. 
   ![Changing member role of a workspace member](./transfer-ownership-member-role.jpg "Changing member role of a workspace member")

3. Change the **member role** of the user who should become the new owner
   ![Selecting owner member role from the list](./transfer-ownership-new-owner.jpg "Selecting owner member role from the list")
   
4. Now the member role of the original owner can be changed (if needed) or they can be removed from the workspace completely.

:::warning
Be careful when downgrading your own member role! 

Only owners and admins can manage user roles so if you assign yourself the writer or reader role, you will not be able to change it back.
