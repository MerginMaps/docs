[[toc]]

After signing up to <MainPlatformNameLink />, you can use your workspace for free during the **28 day trial**. After the trial, you can choose from our <MainDomainNameLink id="pricing" desc="subscription plans"/> depending on the storage size, size of your team, support level and other features that you need for your [workspace](../../manage/workspaces/). 

There are three paid plans: *Individual*, *Professional*, and *Team* plan. Students and educators can use our free *Academia* plan and there is also a *Non-profit* plan available to charities and non-profit organisations. Subscriptions are billed monthly or annually.

### Updating billing details



### Adding and removing the payment method
When purchasing a subscription plan, you will be asked to fill out your card information.

If you want to change your payment method, e.g. when [transferring ownership and billing for a workspace](#how-to-transfer-ownership-and-billing-for-workspaces), you have to add a new card first (any active subscription requires a payment method).

To add a new card, click on **Add payment method** and fill out the details.

To remove a card from your profile, click on the button next to the card and **Delete** it.
