# Subscriptions and Invoicing
[[toc]]

After signing up to <MainPlatformNameLink />, you can use your workspace for free during the **28 day trial**. After the trial, you can choose from our <MainDomainNameLink id="pricing" desc="subscription plans"/> depending on the storage size, size of your team, support level and other features that you need for your [workspace](../../manage/workspaces/). 

::: tip
For details about different subscription plans visit our <MainDomainNameLink id="pricing" desc="pricing page"/>.

If you are interested in <MainDomainNameLink id="pricing-for-ce-and-ee" desc="On-Premise deployment"/>  or looking for other options, please <MerginMapsEmail id="sales" desc="contact us" /> directly.
:::

There are three paid plans: *Individual*, *Professional*, and *Team* plan. Students and educators can use our free *Academia* plan and there is also a *Non-profit* plan available to charities and non-profit organisations. Subscriptions are billed monthly or annually.

The overview of your current subscription plan and usage of storage, number of projects and number of users in your workspace can be found in the **Subscription** tab in <DashboardLink />. It is available only to the [owners](../permissions/#workspace-member-roles) of the workspace.

## Subscriptions management portal
Subscriptions, payments and billing information are managed in our subscription management portal. 

**There are two ways to access the portal**:
- from [Mergin Maps dashboard](#accessing-subscription-management-portal-from-mergin-maps-dashboard) by owners of a workspace
- [using a link](#accessing-subscription-management-portal-directly-without-mergin-maps-account) by a person that has access to the email used in billing information

![Mergin Maps subscription plan overview](./stripe-merginmaps-subcription.jpg "Mergin Maps subscription plan overview")

When logged into the portal, you can [update](#how-to-change-a-subscription) or [cancel](#how-to-cancel-a-subscription) your subscription, see upcoming charges, review your [billing and payment information](#billing-information-and-payment-method) and access [payment history and invoices](#invoices-and-payment-history).

### Accessing subscription management portal from Mergin Maps dashboard
If you are the owner of a workspace, you can access the subscription management portal from the <DashboardShortLink />.

To access the portal, navigate to the **Subscription** tab and click on **Manage Subscription**.
![Mergin Maps Dashboard manage subscription](./subscriptions-update.jpg "Mergin Maps Dashboard manage subscription")

You will be redirected to the subscription management portal.

### Accessing subscription management portal directly (without Mergin Maps account)
The subscription management portal can also accessed directly, without going through the <DashboardShortLink /> or having a <MainPlatformName /> account. This option may be useful if the person taking care of the payments does not need access to the projects and data, such as someone from the accounting department of your organisation. 

Note that the owner of the workspace needs to set up the appropriate email in the [billing information](#billing-information-and-payment-method). This email can then be used to access the portal.

To access the portal directly:
1. Navigate to the [**subscription management portal**](https://payments.merginmaps.com/p/login/14keYH711d32dz2144)
2. Enter the **email** that is used in your [billing information](#billing-information-and-payment-method) and click on **Send**
   ![Logging in to stripe with an email](./stripe-sign-in.jpg "Logging in to stripe with an email")

3. You will get an email with a login link. Click on the link in the email and you will be redirected to the portal.
