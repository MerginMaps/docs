## Changing Mergin Maps username

The username cannot be changed. If you need to use a different username, you will have to create a new account.

**If you are a contributor to a workspace, but do not own a workspace:**
1. Create a new <MainPlatformName /> account with the username of your choice
2. Make a list of workspaces/projects you have access to with your original account
3. Notify the *admins* or *owners* of the relevant workspaces about this change.
   They will have to [share the workspace or projects](../project-advanced/#share-projects-and-manage-user-access) with your new account.
4. Now your original account can be [deleted](#deleting-mergin-maps-account)

**If you own a workspace:**
1. Create a new <MainPlatformName /> account with the username of your choice
2. [Transfer the ownership](../permissions/#how-to-transfer-ownership-of-a-workspace) of your workspace(s) to the new account and, if needed, [update the billing information](../subscriptions/#billing-information-and-payment-method)
3. Now you can [delete](#deleting-mergin-maps-account) the original account

::: tip Re-using email
The same email cannot be used for multiple accounts. If you want to reuse the same email that you have used in your original account, you will have to [close](#deleting-mergin-maps-account) it and wait until it is deleted. Deleted accounts are kept on <MainPlatformName /> servers for 5 days before they are deleted permanently.

To speed up the process, you can contact <MerginMapsEmail id="support" /> and ask them to delete your account so you can use the same email immediately.
