## Workspaces in Mergin Maps
Workspaces are used to efficiently manage projects, users and subscriptions. 

Every workspace is tied to a [subscription](https://merginmaps.com/pricing). The subscription plan defines the amount of data storage for the workspace as well as other features, such as commercial use or the level of [support](../../misc/troubleshoot/#support).

One workspace can contain multiple projects. The only limit is the storage quota (as defined by the subscription). If needed, projects can be transferred to another workspace.

Users can be invited to a workspace as [members or guests](../permissions/). These users don't need to have their own subscription.
