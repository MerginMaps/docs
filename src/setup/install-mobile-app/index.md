With the <MobileAppNameShort />, you can view your data and location on the map, capture points, lines, areas, photos and much more.

Download <MobileAppName /> to your Android device, iPhone or iPad. You can find it in the app store of your platform:

<AppDownload></AppDownload>

You can use the <MobileAppNameShort /> without having a <MainPlatformName /> account. Our [Capturing Your First Field Data](../../tutorials/capturing-first-data/index.md) tutorial will show you how to create a project and capture your first data in the field.

However, to make full use of <MainPlatformNameLink />, we recommend you [signing up to Mergin Maps](../sign-up-to-mergin-maps/). When sign in, you can use <DashboardLink /> to, e.g., manage your projects and share them with other users, or use our <QGISPluginNameShort /> to get your data and projects to <QGIS link="en/site/forusers/download.html" text="QGIS" />.
