To make full use of the <MainPlatformNameLink /> service, you need to sign up. You can sign up either through <MainDomainNameLink /> or from your mobile device using the <MobileAppName />.

::: tip
Public projects can be accessed and downloaded even without a <MainPlatformNameLink /> account, but projects can be managed, shared and synchronised only when you are logged in.

2. Fill in the registration form and click on **Sign Up**.

After the trial, you can [upgrade your subscription](../../subscriptions/#how-to-upgrade-a-subscription-from-the-trial-plan).
