# How to Sign Up to Mergin Maps
[[toc]]

To make full use of the <MainPlatformNameLink /> service, you need to sign up. You can sign up either through <MainDomainNameLink /> or from your mobile device using the <MobileAppName />.

Public projects can be accessed and downloaded even without a <MainPlatformNameLink /> account, but projects can be managed, shared and synchronised only when you are logged in.

   ::: tip Workspaces and subscriptions
   Projects, collaborations and subscriptions in <MainPlatformNameLink /> are tied to [workspaces](../../manage/workspaces/). You can use your first  workspace for free during the 28 day trial. After the trial, you can [upgrade to a premium plan](../../manage/subscriptions/#how-to-upgrade-a-subscription-from-the-trial-plan).
   
   [Subscriptions](../../manage/subscriptions) are based on the number of contributors on the workspace. Per each contributor seat, you get 1 GB of storage. Storage is shared across the whole workspace.
   
   See our <MainDomainNameLink id="pricing" desc="pricing page"/> for more details.
