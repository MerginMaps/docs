To make full use of the <MainPlatformNameLink /> service, you need to sign up. You can sign up either through <MainDomainNameLink /> or from your mobile device using the <MobileAppName />.

::: tip
Public projects can be accessed and downloaded even without a <MainPlatformNameLink /> account, but projects can be managed, shared and synchronised only when you are logged in.

5. Now your account needs a [workspace](../../manage/workspaces/)!
- If you were invited to an existing workspace, you can simply **join** this workspace without creating a new one

   Projects, collaborations and subscriptions in <MainPlatformNameLink /> are tied to [workspaces](../../manage/workspaces/). If you create your own workspace, it will be automatically signed up as a free tier workspace with 100 MB of storage. To upgrade your subscription, see our <MainDomainNameLink id="pricing" desc="Subscription plans" />.
