Public projects can be accessed and downloaded even without a <MainPlatformNameLink /> account, but projects can be managed, shared and synchronised only when you are logged in.

4. Now your account needs a [workspace](../../manage/workspaces/)!
- If you were invited to an existing workspace, you can simply **join** this workspace without creating a new one

- If you want to create your own workspace, choose an appropriate name and click on **Create workspace**
