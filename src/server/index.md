# Overview

SaaS <MainPlatformName /> service is a web platform for storage and synchronisation of data between mobile devices, <MainPlatformNameLink /> service and QGIS Desktop. 

There is also <MainPlatformName /> Community Edition (<CommunityPlatformNameLink />) that is licensed as open source software. The source code for <CommunityPlatformName /> can be modified and used for custom deployments. You can contribute your code to <GitHubRepo id="MerginMaps/server" />.

Mergin Maps Enterprise Edition (<EnterprisePlatformNameLink />) provides an enterprise environment with additional features such as multiple [workspaces](../manage/workspaces/) or [webmaps](../manage/dashboard-maps/). There are three types of <EnterprisePlatformNameLink />:
- *Cloud* that uses <AppDomainNameLink /> (the same server as is used by other <MainPlatformName /> users)
- *Private-Cloud* where <MainPlatformName /> is run on a different server hosted by us
- *On-Premises* is a self-hosting option where you host your own server

This section of documentation is relevant for the **On-Premises <EnterprisePlatformName />** and **<CommunityPlatformName />**.
