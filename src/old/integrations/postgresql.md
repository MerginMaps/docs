# PostgreSQL

Integrating with other databases is an important feature provided by the DB sync tool, 
hosted in [lutraconsulting/mergin-db-sync](https://github.com/lutraconsulting/mergin-db-sync)
repository. It takes care of synchronization of changes between a Mergin project and a PostgreSQL 
database. The synchronization works both ways: it pushes changes from PostgreSQL to Mergin and 
it also pulls changes from Mergin to PostgreSQL. Please see the project page for more details.
