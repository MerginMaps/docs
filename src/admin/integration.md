# Integrate Mergin 

Mergin is an open platform that aims to be developer friendly, 
and it has been designed to allow easy integration with other software.

## Python Client

### Installation 

The easiest way to use Mergin programmatically is to use the Python 
client module. It is available in the PyPI repository and so it can 
be installed with `pip`:

```
pip3 install mergin-client
```

### Python module 

A quick code example to download a project:

```python
from mergin import MerginClient

mc = MerginClient(login='john', password='pass')
mc.download_project('john/project1', '/home/john/mergin/project1')
```

You can of course also get project status, push/pull changes, create/delete projects 
and more.

The source code of the Python client is available on GitHub in [lutraconsulting/mergin-py-client](https://github.com/lutraconsulting/mergin-py-client) repository.

### Command Line Interface

For those who prefer using terminal, there is `mergin` command line tool 
shipped with the Python client.
With several built-in commands, it is possible to download Mergin projects, 
push/pull changes, create or delete projects and more.

For example, to download a Mergin project to a local directory:
```
mergin download john/project1 ~/mergin/project1
```

Please see [lutraconsulting/mergin-py-client](https://github.com/lutraconsulting/mergin-py-client) repository for
more information on the usage.

## C++ Standalone Client

C++ Client has advantage over Python that is is completely 
without any dependencies.
