# How to Stake Out Points
<Badge text="since Input 1.3.0" type="tip"/>

Points in your survey layers can be staked out. <MobileAppName /> will navigate you towards the selected point showing you the direction and distance.

There are two stake out modes:
- long navigation mode
- short navigation mode

:::tip
Accurate stake out in short navigation mode may require an [external GPS receiver](../external_gps/) with GPS corrections.

1. Select a point in your map window. From the form select the **Stake out** icon:
