# How to Stake Out Points
<SinceBadge type="App" version="1.3.0" />

Points in your survey layers can be staked out. <MobileAppName /> will navigate you towards the selected point showing you the direction and distance.

There are two stake out modes:
- long navigation mode
- short navigation mode

:::tip
Accurate stake out in short navigation mode may require an [external GPS receiver](../external_gps/) with GPS corrections.

1. Select a point in your map window. From the form select the **Stake out** icon:

2. Stake out panel will appear showing the current distance and a connecting line between your position and the point.
