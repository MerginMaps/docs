## GPS
By default, the map centred around the project extent. Pressing and holding GPS icon, will turn on the GPS auto-centre mode.

GPS signal colour on the map denotes the accuracy threshold set by user within the Input settings (See Settings section).

## Record
This option will allow user to capture the position of the GPS and save it as point or line vertices. Pressing the **Record**  button will list all the survey layers (point and line layers within the project not marked as read-only in the QGIS project properties). User can then select a layer.

If a point layer is selected, a point geometry will be recorded at the location of the GPS. A form (attribute table) for the point will appear for user to fill in.

If a line layer is selected, a path will be generated from the GPS track until the record button is pressed again. The form for the recorded line will appear accordingly.

Pressing and holding **Record** button will allow you to set the default survey layer. This option is also available under the **Settings** section.

## Zoom to project
This is a shortcut to zoom the extent of all visible layers within the project.

## Map themes
Themes generated from QGIS project will be listed here. User can switch between different map themes using this option.

## Settings
Input specific configuration can be accessed through settings.

### Mergin

Displays the current user signed in to Mergin. To clear the log in, users can tap on their name.

### GPS

**Follow GPS with map** will pan the map so the GPS point can be seen on the map.

**GPS accuracy** colours show the current strength of the signal based on the Accuracy threshold. If the signal falls within the the threshold, the colour will be green. If it is outside, it will be orange. The indicator will be red in case there is no GPS position fix available.

**Line rec. interval** when streaming GPS position for capturing lines, you can set the intervals at which the GPS location will be used as vertices of the line.
