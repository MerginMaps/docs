Below is a description of various items within the user interface. 

The map can be moved by dragging around and zoomed in/out by pinching open/close.

There are four tabs available in the bottom navigation panel: [Projects](#projects), [GPS](#gps), [Record](#record) and [More](#zoom-to-project-browse-features-map-themes-settings).
