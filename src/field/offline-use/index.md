# Offline Use of Mergin Maps Input
[[toc]]

The <MobileAppName /> app can be used  without internet connection, which is useful if you need to do the field survey in areas with poor cell phone signal or limited mobile internet. Collecting data in the field and synchronising them in the office using WiFi can be also more effective when working with large files. However, there are some features that work only online.

Even **offline**, you can:
:white_check_mark:  see your position displayed (location services has to be enabled)
:white_check_mark:  [add, edit and delete feature](../input_features/) as well as see their details
:white_check_mark:  [capture photos](../../layer/settingup_forms_photo/)
:white_check_mark:  [stake out features](../stake-out/)
:white_check_mark:  see all layers that are packaged in your project, including offline [background maps](../../gis/settingup_background_map/#background-maps)

On the other hand, there are some features that require internet connection and **cannot be done offline**, such as:
:no_entry_sign: [synchronising](../autosync/) changes to the cloud
:no_entry_sign: displaying online layers, such as [background maps](../../gis/settingup_background_map/)
:no_entry_sign: signing in or switching account
:no_entry_sign: switching to another [workspace](../../manage/workspaces/#switch-workspaces-in-mergin-maps-input)
:no_entry_sign: [create](../../manage/create-project/#create-a-project-in-mergin-maps-input) new projects
:no_entry_sign: downloading projects from the cloud or browsing public projects


## Offline field survey workflow
Using <MobileAppName /> offline, you can work with all packaged layers in the same way as if you were online.

:::tip
 *Packaged* layers are those that are stored in your <MainPlatformName /> project and you can see them in your <MainPlatformName /> project's folder. You can read more about this topic in [<MainPlatformName /> project ](../../manage/project/#packaging-qgis-project).
:::

An example workflow of an offline use-case:
1. downloading the app, signing in
2. user has all the required layers offline - downloading project to the app
3. collects data/photos in area with no internet access
4. upload the data at the end of the day when back in the office.
