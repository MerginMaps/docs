# Mergin Maps Enterprise Edition
[[toc]]

Mergin Maps Enterprise Edition (<MainPlatformName /> EE) is a self-hosting option for those who want to run their own deployment of <MainPlatformNameLink />. <MainPlatformName /> EE is a containerised application which runs on a host machine using [`docker-compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). 

We recommend using a dedicated host machine with 8GB of memory. The requirements for CPU and persistent storage depend largely on the frequency of project updates and the anticipated size of the data you expect to store respectively.
