# Custom Mobile App

The <MobileAppName /> provides seamless synchronisation of data between your phone/tablet and <MainPlatformName /> service. We know that sometimes people want a mobile app optimised for a specific use case rather than just using a general purpose app like <MobileAppName />.

The good news is that <MobileAppName /> is licensed as open source software and therefore it is possible to build custom apps off it. Maybe you just want to change the branding or disable some functionality - or maybe you want a bigger overhaul of the user interface - anything is possible with a bit of development. 

## GitHub

If you are interested in building a custom app, you can start by going to <GitHubRepo id="lutraconsulting/input" desc="Mergin Maps Input repository" /> on GitHub and building it for your platform. The <GitHubRepo id="lutraconsulting/input-sdk" desc="Input SDK repository" /> provides all the dependencies for various platforms (Android, iOS, macOS, Windows).

For the <MobileAppName /> source code and developers' documentation, you can visit <GitHubRepo id="lutraconsulting/input" />.
