# Custom Mobile App

Our mobile app <MobileAppName /> provides seamless synchronisation of field data between mobile devices and <MainPlatformName /> service. However, we know that sometimes people want a mobile app optimised for a specific use case: maybe you just want to change the branding or disable some functionality - or maybe you want a bigger overhaul of the user interface. 

The good news is that <MobileAppName /> is licensed as open source software, which means that anything is possible with a bit of development!

If you are interested in building a custom app, you can start by going to <GitHubRepo id="MerginMaps/input"/> repository on GitHub and building it for your platform.

The <GitHubRepo id="MerginMaps/input-sdk" desc="Input SDK repository" /> provides all the dependencies for various platforms (Android, iOS, macOS, Windows).
