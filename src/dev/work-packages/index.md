# Work Packages
[[toc]]

The <MainPlatformName /> Work Packages tool is designed to manage field surveys for multiple teams. This tool allows to create <MainPlatformName /> *work packages projects* that contain a subset of data of the main <MainPlatformName /> project and set up two-way synchronisation between the main project and the dependent projects as illustrated here:

The main <MainPlatformName /> project (*Survey*) contains all data. The admin of the main project can assign some of the data to working package projects (*Survey Team A*, *Survey Team B*). The teams can see and modify only the data that are assigned to them.
