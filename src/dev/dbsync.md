# PostgreSQL DB Sync

DB Sync is a tool that takes care of two-way synchronisation between <MainPlatformName /> and PostGIS databases. The synchronisation works both ways: changes made in a PostGIS database are automatically pushed to a configured <MainPlatformName /> project and changes made in a GeoPackage in the <MainPlatformName /> project are pushed to the PostGIS database.

Here, you will also find the Quick start guide that will show you how to set up one way synchronisation between your PostGIS database and a new <MainPlatformName /> project.
