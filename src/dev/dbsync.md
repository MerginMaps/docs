# PostgreSQL DB Sync

DB Sync is a tool that takes care of two-way synchronisation between <MainPlatformName /> and PostGIS databases. The synchronisation works both ways: changes made in a PostGIS database are automatically pushed to a configured <MainPlatformName /> project and changes made in a GeoPackage in the <MainPlatformName /> project are pushed to the PostGIS database.

**Interested in using DB Sync?** Go to <GitHubRepo id="MerginMaps/mergin-db-sync" /> repository for the source code and more details. You can also follow the [Quick start guide](https://github.com/MerginMaps/mergin-db-sync/blob/master/docs/quick_start.md) to set up one way synchronisation between your PostGIS database and a new <MainPlatformName /> project.
