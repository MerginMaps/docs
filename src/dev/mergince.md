# Mergin Maps Community Edition
[[toc]]

SaaS <MainPlatformName /> service is a web platform for storage and synchronisation of data between mobile devices, <MainPlatformNameLink /> service and QGIS Desktop. 

There is also <MainPlatformName /> Community Edition (<CommunityPlatformNameLink />) that is licensed as open source software. The source code for <CommunityPlatformName /> can be modified and used for custom deployments. You can contribute your code to <GitHubRepo id="MerginMaps/server" />.

[How to Use <MainPlatformName /> with a Custom Server](../manage/plugin-multi-server-use/) will explain how to use <QGISPluginName /> and <MobileAppName /> with your <CommunityPlatformName /> server.

::: tip
More information about <CommunityPlatformName /> and its features can be found on our [website](https://merginmaps.com/pricing-for-ce-and-ee) and in our blog [<MainPlatformName /> Community and Enterprise Editions](https://merginmaps.com/blog/introducing-mergin-maps-community-and-enterprise-editions).

## Deployment
Follow these steps to run local <MainPlatformName /> instance.

### Start docker containers
Provided that `docker` and `docker-compose` are installed on your host, running <MainPlatformName /> stack should be as simple as running `docker-compose`. However, before doing that you would need to [configure](#configure-environment) your server setup via environment variables in <GitHubRepo desc=".prod.env" id="MerginMaps/server/blob/master/.prod.env" /> file. 

Once configured, you can run:
```shell
$ mkdir -p projects # or wherever you set it to be
$ sudo chown -R  901:999 ./projects/
$ sudo chmod g+s ./projects/
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up
```
‚Äã‚Äã
### Initialise database
If server is started for the first time, database needs to be initialised and super-user created (set admin username, password and email):
```shell
$ docker exec merginmaps-server flask init-db
$ docker exec merginmaps-server flask user create <username> <password> --is-admin --email <email>
```
‚Äã
### Configure environment
There are several application settings which can be changed via <GitHubRepo desc="config variables" id="MerginMaps/server/blob/master/.prod.env" />. Some of them have defaults and some of them needs to be modified, particularly those with `fixme` placeholder (marked with asterisks below).

## Migration guides

Follow our [**Migration Guides**](./ce-migration/) to migrate from older server versions to the latest version of <CommunityPlatformName />.‚Äã


## Troubleshooting

Find the common server deployment issues here.

### Server is not properly configured
Did you get an error that the server is not properly configured?
![Mergin Maps CE server not configured error](./ce-server-not-configured.jpg "Mergin Maps CE server not configured error")

1. Check if `MERGIN_BASE_URL` docker environment variable is assigned correctly.
   `MERGIN_BASE_URL` should contain the URL of your <CommunityPlatformName /> server.
   
2. Restart the container with the `MERGIN_BASE_URL` variable


## Opt out of sending statistics
<SinceBadge type="Server" version="2023.2" />

By default, <CommunityPlatformName /> collects anonymous usage information to make the service better. There is a variable named `COLLECT_STATISTICS` that controls if statistics are collected and sent. 

If you do not want to provide these data, you can opt-out any time by setting this variable to *false* 
```
COLLECT_STATISTICS=false
```
