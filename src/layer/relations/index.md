# Relations
[[toc]]

There are cases when multiple records from one layer (or table) relate to one feature from another layer, forming one to many (1-N) relation. For instance, there may be multiple photos of one feature, multiple inspections of the same feature or multiple parts, or one feature consisting of multiple polygons with different properties. As these use cases vary, there are different options for how to set up forms for relations.

<QGISHelp ver="latest" link="/user_manual/working_with_vector/joins_relations.html" text="See QGIS Documentation" /> to learn more about connecting and editing data across layers.

:::tip Example projects and guides available
You can take a closer look at 1-N relations:
- Public project <MerginMapsProject id="documentation/forms-relations" /> contains the setup described on this page as well as sample data
- [How to Link Multiple Records to One Feature](../one-to-n-relations/) explains how to add multiple **records** to a single feature. See also our public project: <MerginMapsProject id="documentation/forms_one-to-many-relations" />
- [How to Attach Multiple Photos to Features ](../photos/#how-to-attach-multiple-photos-to-one-feature) shows how to add multiple **photos** to a single feature. See also our public project: <MerginMapsProject id="documentation/forms_multiple_photos" />
:::

As an example, we will use a project with two spatial layers: **parks** and **amenities**. One park can have multiple amenities, such as benches, picnic tables, fireplaces or water fountains. Every amenity feature can be located in one park only. Thus, the relation between these layers is one to many (1-*N*): 1 park to *N* amenities. 

This means that **parks** are the referenced (parent) layer and **amenities** are the referencing (child) layer. They will be related based on the *primary keys* of parks and corresponding *foreign keys* of the amenities layer, linking amenities to a specific park.

*Primary keys* are unique IDs. While all layers have a default ID field when created (`fid`, `id`), these IDs can be changed during synchronisation in <MainPlatformName />, e.g. when multiple surveyors capture new features at the same time (see [Behind data synchronisation](../../manage/synchronisation/#behind-data-synchronisation) for detailed explanation). As a result, child features could end up being linked to a wrong parent feature.

Therefore, **we strongly recommend creating a new field for primary keys and using UUIDs generated by the `uuid()` function when a feature is created [as described below](#generating-unique-ids-uuid)**. UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) ensures that the primary keys are unique even after synchronisation and that the correct features are linked.

## One to many relation setup
One to many (1-N) relation needs to be set up in your <MainPlatformName /> project in QGIS as follows:
1. [Create unique UUID field](#generating-unique-ids-uuid) for your referenced (parent) layer and a field for storing foreign keys in the referencing (child) layer
3. Define the relation in [Project Properties](#setting-up-relation-in-qgis)
4. [Configure Attributes forms](#attributes-forms-configuration-for-1-n-relations) of both layers as needed

### Generating unique IDs (UUID)

:::tip UUID as unique primary keys
<QGISHelp ver="latest" link="user_manual/expressions/functions_list.html#uuid" text="UUID" /> (Universally Unique Identifier) is generated to be unique and will not be changed when synced. Therefore, **we strongly recommend using UUID to link layers**.
:::

To create a field for storing unique UUIDs:

1. Add a new field with `Text (string)` data type, here: `uuid`
   ![Adding new text field](./uuid-field.webp "Adding new text field")
   
2. Use the `uuid()` as the [**default value**](../default-values/) for this field in **Layer Properties**. 

   This function assigns a unique identifier to every created feature, even when different surveyors create features simultaneously.
   ![UUID as default value in Attributes Form](./uuid-default.webp "UUID as default value in Attributes Form")
   
   **Do not use** the *apply default value on update* option. The generated UUID should not be changed.

::: tip Field for foreign keys
To create a 1-N relation between two layers, the referencing (child) layer needs to have a field for storing foreign keys. 

This field needs to have the same data type as the primary key: `Text (string)`. Here we will use `fk-uuid`.
:::


### Setting up relation in QGIS
Now let's look at the 1-N relation setup in QGIS:
1. From the main menu, select **Projects** > **Properties ...**
   ![QGIS menu Project properties](./qgis-project-properties.webp "QGIS menu Project properties")

2. In the **Relations** tab, click on the  **Add Relation** button
![QGIS project properties, Relations tab, Add Relation button](./qgis_relation_tab.webp "QGIS project properties, Relations tab, Add Relation button")

3. Specify the relation:
   - **Id** is generated automatically
   - **Name** is the name of the relation, here `park-amenities-relation`
   - **Referenced (parent)** is the parks layer, here:`parent-park`
   - **Field 1** of the **Referenced (parent)** is the field `uuid` that contains the **unique** UUID created as described [here](#generating-unique-ids-uuid)
   - **Referencing (child)** is the amenities layer, here: `child-amenities`
   - **Field 1** of the **Referencing (child)** layer is the `fk-uuid`, which acts as a foreign key to link amenities to parks

   ![One to many relation setup in QGIS](./qgis-add-relation.webp "One to many relation setup in QGIS")

4. Confirm the setup by clicking **OK**

The one to many relation between **parks** and **amenities** is now set in QGIS. Next we can configure the forms for both layers.

### Attributes forms configuration for 1-N relations
Attributes form for both linked layers can be set up as needed, depending on the preferred data collection method for the referencing (child) layer:
- Child features can be added through the form of the [referenced (parent) layer](#referenced-parent-layer-attributes-form-relations-widget), meaning you can use the attributes form of the **parks** layer to add/edit/remove **amenities**.
- Child features can be added through the form of the [referencing (child) layer](#referencing-child-layer-attributes-form-relation-reference-widget). A new feature can be added to the **amenities** layer and the link to the corresponding **park** feature is set manually in the attributes form.

Both options work both in QGIS and in the [<MobileAppNameShort />](#relation-widgets-in-mergin-maps-mobile-app).

#### Referenced (parent) layer attributes form - relations widget
Explore the attributes form of the referenced (parent) layer **parks**:
1. Navigate to the **Attributes** form tab in **Layer Properties**
2. Notice the `park-amenities-relation` was automatically added to the list of available widgets as **Relations**.

   If you use [Drag and Drop Designer](../form-layout/#qgis-drag-and-drop-designer), you can add or remove the relation widget from the form manually.

   ![One to many relation setup in QGIS](./qgis-forms-relations-setup.webp "One to many relation setup in QGIS")

In QGIS, the attributes form looks like this:

![QGIS attributes form relation](./qgis-form-parent.webp "QGIS attributes form relation")

Note the editable `park-amenities-relation` with the option to add new (child) features to the **amenities** layer directly from the **parks** form.


#### Referencing (child) layer attributes form - relation reference widget
The referencing (child) layer **amenities** can also have the relation added to the attributes form.

1. Navigate to the **Attributes** form tab in **Layer Properties**
2. Select the foreign key field (here: `fk-uuid`) in the list of fields.

   Choose **Relation Reference** as **Widget Type**:
   - **Display expression** sets the display name of referenced layer (here: `name`)
   - **Relation** offers all available relations defined in the project (here: `park-amenities-relation`)

   ![QGIS attributes form relation reference setup](./qgis-form-child-setup.webp "QGIS attributes form relation reference setup")

In QGIS, the attributes form of the referencing (child) **amenities** layer looks like this. The foreign key field `fk-uuid` offers a drop-down menu with the list of features from the referenced (parent) layer **parks**.

In this case, the link between the amenity feature and the park can be set (or edited) manually.

## Relation widgets in Mergin Maps mobile app
Now let's look how these relation widgets look like in the <MobileAppNameShort />. 

:::tip Example project available
[Clone the public project](../../manage/create-project/#clone-a-public-project) <MerginMapsProject id="documentation/forms-relations" /> to see the setup and sample data on your mobile device.
:::

There are two ways to add child features to a parent feature in the <MobileAppNameShort />: using the [relation widget](#relation-widget) on the parent layer or using the [relation reference widget](#relation-reference-widget) on the child layer.

![Mergin Maps mobile app relation widgets](./mobile-relation-widgets.gif "Mergin Maps mobile app relation widgets")

### Relation widget

The referenced (parent) features have the [relation widget](#referenced-parent-layer-attributes-form-relations-widget) in the attributes form. It displays all linked child features in a row. 

Here, **parks** feature `Park B` already contains a link to a `bench` from the **amenities** layer. Tapping on the child feature `bench` opens its attributes form with the option to edit the feature.

A new child feature can be added by tapping the **+** button:

![Mergin Maps mobile app relation widget](./mobile-form-relation-widget.webp "Mergin Maps mobile app relation widget")

- If the referencing (child) layer is a spatial layer, you will be asked to record geometry. Here **amenities** are captured as points. Note that it is not possible to change the [active layer](../../field/mobile-features/#adding-features).
- In the form, you can fill in information about the child feature (here we add a `picnic table`). Note that the relation reference (foreign key `fk-uuid`) is filled in automatically based on the parent feature (here `Park B`).
- Save the changes. The form of the `Park B` feature now displays one more entry in the relation widget (`picnic table`).

![Mergin Maps mobile app relation widget added child feature](./mobile-form-added-child-feature.webp "Mergin Maps mobile app relation widget added child feature")

### Relation reference widget
You can also add a new feature to the referencing (child) layer directly:
- Tap the **Add** button and capture the geometry
- Fill in the Attributes form. Note that the [relation reference](#referencing-child-layer-attributes-form-relation-reference-widget) (foreign key, here `fk-uuid`) is empty and needs to be entered manually by choosing a feature from the referenced (parent) layer.
- Save the changes.
