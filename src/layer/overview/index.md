Capturing field data usually requires filling some attributes in the form to record the properties of surveyed points, lines, polygons or non-spatial features. Attribute forms can simplify the data entry and even ensure to some extent that the correct information is filled in.

This section will guide you through various settings of attributes form for both spatial and non-spatial layers. 

[Widgets](../form-widgets/) provides a comprehensive overview of <QGISHelp ver="latest" link="user_manual/working_with_vector/vector_properties.html#attributes-form-properties" text="QGIS widgets" /> and their use in <MainPlatformNameLink />.

Extra configuration of attribute forms can be done to make data collection easier and more consistent:
- use [default values](../default-values/) to automatically record attribute's values
- set [constraints](../constraints/) to define valid inputs for the attributes
- design the [attributes forms layout](../form-layout/) so that the forms are easy to work with

In [Use Cases](../use-cases), you can find step-by-step guides to deal with specific scenarios, such as [opening files](../open-file/) from within the form, [using hyperlinks](../external-link/), [displaying instructions](../display-instructions/) in the form and much more.
