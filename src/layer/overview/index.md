# Overview
[[toc]]

Capturing field data includes recording some information about surveyed points, lines, polygons or non-spatial features by filling in attributes form. This section will guide you through various settings of attributes forms for spatial and non-spatial layers.

There are various widgets available to use in the attributes form depending on the field data type and preferred type of data input. [Widgets](../form-widgets/) provide a comprehensive overview of <QGISHelp ver="latest" link="user_manual/working_with_vector/vector_properties.html#attributes-form-properties" text="QGIS widgets" /> and their use in <MainPlatformNameLink />.

Extra configuration of attribute forms can be done to make data collection easier and more consistent, such as:
- using [default values](../default-values/) to automatically record attribute's values
- setting [constraints](../constraints/) to define valid inputs for the attributes
- designing the [attributes forms layout](../form-layout/) so that the forms are easy to work with

In [Use Cases](../use-cases), you can find step-by-step guides to deal with specific scenarios, such as [opening files](../open-file/) from within the form, [using hyperlinks](../external-link/), [displaying instructions](../display-instructions/) in the form and much more.
