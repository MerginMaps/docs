# Working with Non-spatial Tables
[[toc]]

Non-spatial tables are often a key part of a survey project. The tables can be used either on their own to add new data or linked to a spatial layer, e.g. when linking multiple [photos](./attach-multiple-photos-to-features/) or [records](./one-to-n-relations/). They can be also used in [value relation](../layer/settingup_forms/#value-relation) widgets.

We recommend using **GeoPackage** format to save your non-spatial table. With this format, you can collaboratively edit the data and track changes.

## Enable editing and browsing of non-spatial layers
Ensure you have [enabled editing and browsing](../gis/search_data/) of your non-spatial table in **Project Properties** in QGIS.

## Non-spatial layers in Mergin Maps mobile app
Non-spatial tables can be browsed, searched and edited in [**Layers**](../field/layers/) in the **More** tab.

Choose the non-spatial layer from the list in **Layers**. Tap it to open the attributes table. Here, you can browse and [search](../gis/search_data/#searching-for-values-in-mergin-maps-mobile-app). It also possible to [add and edit](../field/mobile-features/#add-non-spatial-features) features.
