# Exif Metadata
[[toc]]
EXIF is a file format for storing metadata in image files, such as the camera settings, image metrics, date and time or location information (see, e.g., [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exif)). 

<MobileAppName /> supports some default value expression functions that can be used to read EXIF metadata and store their values in the fields of your survey layer.

To store GPS EXIF metadata, both <MobileAppName /> and your camera app have [location permissions](#allowing-location-tags) allowed on your mobile device.

## How to use EXIF metadata
To store EXIF metadata values in the fields of your survey layer:
1. In QGIS, open the **Properties** of your survey layer and navigate to the **Attributes Form** tab.
2. Now we need to set the [default values](./settingup_forms_settings/#default-values) of fields that should store EXIF metadata. 
   
   [Supported EXIF functions](#supported-exif-functions) are listed below. In general, EXIF functions looks like this: 
   `read_exif('<ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_IMAGE>', '<EXIF_TAG_STRING>')` 
   
   This expression requires the **absolute path** to an image. The absolute path can be defined using the field where the image is stored (here: `photo`, this is a [text field with attachment widget](./settingup_forms_photo/)) and the `@project_home` variable that refers to the project home folder. 
   
   For example, the default value expression for the direction of the image (EXIF tag `GPSImgDirection`) can be defined as follows:
   
   `read_exif(@project_home + '/' + "photo", 'GPSImgDirection')`
      
   ![exif form](./qgis_form_exif.png)
   
   The preview shows a warning *Function is not known*. **This is OK, <MobileAppName /> will know what to do with it!**

3. Save and sync your project. 

4. Open the project in <MobileAppName />. Once you capture a photo during the field survey, the EXIF metadata values will be automatically filled in:
   ![photos](./gps_exif_metadata.png)

## Supported EXIF functions
EXIF function supported by <MobileAppName />:
- `read_exif_img_direction('<ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_IMAGE>')` returns the direction of the image when captured. The direction is represented by a number.
- `read_exif_latitude('<ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_IMAGE>')` returns GPS Latitude as a decimal number.
- `read_exif_longitude('<ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_IMAGE>')` returns GPS Longitude as a decimal number.
- `read_exif('<ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_IMAGE>', '<EXIF_TAG_STRING>')`, where **EXIF tag string** defines the EXIF property, such as:
   - `GPSImgDirection` returns the direction of the image when captured as a rational. The direction is represented by a rational, e.g. 350/1.
   - `GPSLatitude` returns GPS Latitude as rationals, e.g. 48/1, 6/1, 309275/10000.
   - `GPSLongitude` returns GPS Longitude as rationals, e.g. 17/1, 6/1, 244907/10000.
   - `ImageWidth` returns the image width in pixels.

## Allowing location tags
**Location tags have to be allowed** in the camera settings to store GPS EXIF metadata.

- **Android**: Open Camera app -> Camera settings -> Location tags.

- **iOS**: Open Settings -> Privacy -> Location Services -> Camera (app).
