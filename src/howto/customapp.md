# Custom Mobile App

![](input.svg)

The [Input app](https://inputapp.io/) is a great companion to Mergin as it 
provides seamless synchronisation of data between your phone/tablet and 
Mergin service. We know that sometimes people want a mobile app optimized 
for a specific use case rather than just using a general purpose app like Input.

The good news is that Input is licensed as open source software and therefore 
it is possible to build custom apps off it. Maybe you just want to change the 
branding or disable some functionality - or maybe you want a bigger overhaul 
of the user interface - anything is possible with a bit of development.

## GitHub

If you are interested in building a custom app, you can start by going to 
<GitHubRepo id="lutraconsulting/input" desc="Input App repository" /> on GitHub and 
building it for your platform. 
The <GitHubRepo id="lutraconsulting/input-sdk" desc="Input SDK repository" />
provides all the dependencies for various platforms (Android, iOS, macOS, Windows).

For the Input source code and developers' documentation, you can visit 
<GitHubRepo id="lutraconsulting/input" />.
