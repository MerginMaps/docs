# PostgreSQL DB Sync

Integrating with other databases is an important feature provided by the DB sync tool, 
hosted in <GitHubRepo id="lutraconsulting/mergin-db-sync" />
repository. It takes care of synchronisation of changes between a Mergin project and a PostgreSQL 
database. The synchronization works both ways: it pushes changes from PostgreSQL to Mergin and 
it also pulls changes from Mergin to PostgreSQL. Please see the project page for more details.
