:::tip Getting familiar with <MainPlatformName /> and QGIS
Switching to a new platform can be challenging. This documentation is here to help with the basics as well as some more advanced or specific settings.

To get familiar with <MainPlatformNameLink />, we recommend starting with the [**tutorials**](../../tutorials/capturing-first-data/). If there are specific topics that are crucial for your workflows, feel free to explore the documentation or contact our <MerginMapsEmail id="sales" desc="sales team" /> or our <MerginMapsEmail id="support" desc="support team" /> to get more details.

QGIS is a powerful tool that comes with great community and resources. We recommend using <QGISHelp ver="latest" link="user_manual/index.html" text="QGIS User Guide" /> and <QGISHelp ver="latest" link="training_manual/index.html" text="QGIS Training Manual" /> to explore its functionality.
