When surveying in the field, it is essential to have appropriate background maps. There are several sources of online and offline background maps you can use in your QGIS project. Note that you need to comply with the terms of use of the background maps and their data sources. This page simply explains how to add the data to your QGIS maps and use it in Input. It will be the sole responsibility of the end user to comply with such terms and conditions.

The following sections will cover two types of background maps for online and offline use in Input:
