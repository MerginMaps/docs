It is recommended to run the project status after changing your layers and project. This will help getting a list of pending changes and also see any warnings or validations of your project. The warnings are related to restructuring of a Geopackage layer (adding/removing a field or addding/removing a layer in a Geopackage database). Validations can be linked to missing layer or availability of a layer when working offline:
