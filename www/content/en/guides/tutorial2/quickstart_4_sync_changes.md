So by now you've taken some really insightful field notes and great 
photos and want to sync these changes back to your project.

* Go to *My projects* (if you have your map open you may need to first press *Projects*

When sync changes are pending, your project will have two sync arrows 
next to it:

![Sync Arrows Mean Project Changes are Pending](../images/sync-arrows.png)

* Press the sync arrows to synchronise your project

When the sync completes, you'll see a check mark:

![Check Mark Means All Changes Are Synced](../images/project-with-check-mark.png)

That's all there is to syncing - your changes have been saved on Mergin 
and any changes made by your collaborators have also been synced onto your 
device.

Let's now see how we can share our project.
